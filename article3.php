				<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he Design Museum takes you into the world of fashion designer Paul Smith, a world of creation, inspiration, collaboration, wit and beauty. Celebrating his career to date and exploring future developments, the exhibition references Paul Smithâ€™s influences and fashion designs, charting the rise of this quintessentially English label which has become one of the leading fashion brands in the world.</p>

				<p>It will look at the 40-year career of the designer from Nottingham with ambitions to become a racing cyclist who set up a tiny 3 sq m shop and now heads a global brand stocked in 74 countries. The exhibition will include a range of eclectic pieces from Smith's archive, including a recreation of a section of his office which is famously crammed with books, art, toys, bits of bikes, and an assortment of objects which arrive daily in the designer's sacks of fan mail from around the world - including one mystery admirer who has been sending objects for the past 20 years, everything from a single ski to a broom, never wrapped but simply arriving at his office with an address label and the correct postage.</p>

				<p>Donna Loveday, the exhibition's curator, praised Smith's "unique and innovative take on design" and said that his involvement in his firm as designer and chairman, and his "warmth, humour and wit" had resulted in the company's widely acknowledged personal touch, despite its size. A book 'Hello, my name is Paul Smith: Fashion and other stories' to accompany the exhibition will be edited by Alan Aboud who has worked with Smith on his graphics for the past 20 years and will be published by Rizzoli.</p>
