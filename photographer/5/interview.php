I started my career in 2001 at the age of 18 as a junior graphic designer. Usually good advertising campaigns start with a good photography so I decided to learn photography so I can take photos of my design elements, later on I got an assignment to design &amp; photograph a movie poster, then I’ve decided to take my photography skills to the next level. </p>

<p><b>Where do you find inspiration? </b>
If you want to be a good story teller then TRAVEL! And photography is all about capturing a moment or visualizing a story. </p>

<p><b>Please could you tell us about photography and digital technology?</b>
You don’t need to buy top gear to be a good photographer, but you have to know what type of photography you like the most then decide which piece of equipment is needed to complete the job, there is no lens or camera that has it all. Photography is all about light. the world shines with 1 sun.Technology is booming daily, you have to update your knowledge frequently and keep your software and gear up to date.
