<p><b>For how long have been in photography?</b> about 7 years</p>

<p><b>How did you start?</b> I was working as an IT consultant traveling around the world and I always liked to take snapshorts of the places I had been to. One day I just decided I wanted a digital SLR camera and since I knew nothing about it I decided to read a book about it and within a year I had shot my first magazine cover and was working part time with IT and part time with photography.</p>

<p><b>How would you define yourself as an artist?</b> Well it's strange because I think ever photographer is an artist except for myself, I don't see myself as an artist. I'm not sure why maybe because I find the word to be so noble that to be an artist is something I dream about being but will probably never reach. Hopefully the views of my pictures will think otherwise and see me as an artist. I'm very unusual for an artist because I'm not as impulsive and spontaneous as many artist are. I'm more technical and well planed and maybe this is one of the reasons why I don't see myself as an artist.</p>
 
<p><b>Where do you find inspiration?</b> I find it everywhere in my daily life. The obvious places like magazines, billboards, ads in general, but also in the things surrounding us, like nature, human interaction, it could be a long sequence of things or just a brief spark of something that will make my brain wonder off.</p>

<p><b>Is Brainstorming  not the only creative method  use to create new concepts?</b> Well I guess it depends on how you define a new concept?, I think the nature of human interpretation will always make it into a new concept even though you try to copy an existing concept as hard as you try. Take a concept and bend it into your own will always make it into something new and something YOU. But lots of "new concepts" comes from mother nature. She had it all figured out long ago, humans are just trying to catch up.</p>

<p><b>Please could you tell us about photography and digital technology?</b> As I said I'm very technical and I love gadgets so the digital technology is what made me a photographer. Had we still shot of film I would never have went in this direction. I see at the final picture and judge on that I don't really care if somebody did most part in photoshop or not, the final picture is what counts. That said I think like all other jobs the right tool is half the job. So of course you need to be a good photographer the camera will not shoot the pictures by itself, but I don't agree that a good photographer and make good pictures with all cameras. Having the right tool is necessary to making the perfect result. Therefore I shoot medium format camera with a phaseone digital back.</p>
 
<p><b>Did you work for lnterntonal brands? Which ones?</b> I shot for brands like Gossard and magazine covers for FHM, Stuff, GQ etc.</p>

<p><b>Did you work with Top models?</b> How was your collaboration with them? I worked with a few yes. Well to me a top model is super professional and even though the look is the main thing, they still need to have the right personality to be booked again and again. So working with a top model is in general lovely, because they know exactly what they are doing and are nice to be with.</p>

<p><b>Which of your projects has given you the most satisfaction?</b> Shooting my own things in just the way I like them. To say I don't care what other people think about them would be a lie, but it is what I'm aiming for. If you truly shoot what you believe in you will get the best results.</p>
 
<p><b>Best and worst experience?</b> Best experience have been working with one megamanagement, because they take care of all the practical boring stuff while I get to be as artistic as I can and concentrate on what I do best which is shooting. I don't have that many bad experiences luckily, but everyone have there off days so working with a model who is not really "there" is frustrating. But then again, thats my job to make them "come back". </p>

<p><b>Who are the photographer's you admire the most?</b> I love the big "classics" like Sølve Sundsby, Camilla Åkrans, Patrick Demarchelier, Steven Meisel. But we got some great once here in Denmark to, like Hasse Nielsen and Signe Vilstrup</p>

<p><b>What about architects and designers?</b> In acchitecture I love a lot of the danish classics like Arne Jacobsen. In design I love the once that dares a little more and stick out like Hussein Chalayan or Iris Van Herpen.</p>

<p><b>What are your next projects?</b> I'm working on a few fashion stories as we speak for some danish magazines and I got a few "unnamed" big campaigns in London in the coming months.</p>
