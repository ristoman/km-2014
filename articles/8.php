<li><h3>Erotica Universalis, <em>Gilles Néret</em></h3>

<h4>The art of pleasure</h4>

<h5>An erotic history of humanity</h5>

<p>From the dawn of time, ever since Adam and Eve, all artists of every age—whether the Egyptian, Greek, or Roman artists of Antiquity, or more recent famous names as Rembrandt, Courbet, Degas, or Picasso—have succumbed to their fantasies, obsessions, and libido, and produced erotic works that the censors have taken good care to keep from the public. For Erotica Universalis, we surface from the subterranean realms of the museums to enter those of our national and private libraries. Here we discover that not only most of our famous writers, such as Ovid, Aretino, Voltaire, Verlaine, or Maupassant, wrote erotic texts that bordered on indecency, but also that great artists like Boucher, Fragonard, Dalí, or Matisse were inspired to provide suitable illustrations for these naughty books. For this new hardcover edition of the classic 1995 bestseller, we have culled highlights from our Erotica Universalis collection. A banquet for the imagination and a feast of the eye! </p>

<h4>How green is your blueprint?</h4>

<h5>Architecture as sustainable technology</h5>

<p>The ecological impact of new construction, once a secondary concern, has become a crucial issue in recent years. Badly designed buildings guzzle natural resources and pollute their surroundings. In an era of rocketing energy costs and environmental degradation, the need for a sustainable, energy-efficient architecture is paramount. This book examines the emergent innovations, aesthetics, and pioneers of green architecture, including such artists, architects and firms as Tadao Ando, Shigeru Ban, Diller Scofidio + Renfro, Zaha Hadid, Morphosis, and many more. </p>
