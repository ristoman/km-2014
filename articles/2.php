				<h3 class='delta'>Please describe yourself, are you a designer, artist, etc.?</h3>
				<p>I have the title of Artistic Director for my own brand and yes, I am in the Art and Design department. I could do a performance and I like doing experimental arts as well. But it doesn't mean that I am an Artist. I guess every creative person has their own choice to be called designer or an artist. I think the title 'Designer' best fits my responsibilities.</p>
				<h3 class='delta'>How did you first get involved with arts and design?</h3>
				
				<p>Since I was young, I have always been fascinated by the quirkiness of a painting, a sculpture, costume, textile, music etc… and I started to create my own little comic and painting when I was in school. Then I decided to go to art college to immerse myself deeper into the whole universe of arts and design. Ever since then my life has been related to them.</p>
				<h3 class='delta'>What is the best about creativity today?</h3>
				
				<p>I think if we are talking about the creativity today, we need to relate it with yesterday. Today, creativity has totally changed and is different from how it used to be only a few years ago. Back then, the best way to show creativity was allowing yourself to make mistakes and be as expressive as you wanted to be without thinking of other aspects… and to make life more fun and interesting with what you had created. Today, creativity has become very restrictive and competitive but at the same time it has become a serious business in many ways. Creativity now has become the number one tool of communication - not just when it comes to fun and enjoyment or expressing yourself, but it has to be seen from a business perspective and how one can benefit from it.</p>
				<h3 class='delta'>What does art mean in your opinion?</h3>
				
				<p>In my opinion art is something spiritual that is coming from the deeper imagination and skills of the artist. Art is also a way to express emotions in a different kind of form and a way to share them with others. </p>
				<h3 class='delta'>What is the design mean in your opinion?</h3>
				
				<p>The meaning of “design” is very wide. It depends on the perspective you choose to regard it from. It can be the shape, the value, the modernity, the creation of something,…but for me when it comes to design, it means product. Something that we created for a direct purpose. We want to sell the design/product at the end of the day, so that people will use our product and appreciate the great feeling of it.</p>
				<h3 class='delta'>What do you think if someone tells you that “fashion is material of culture”?</h3>
				<p>I agree, the approach of fashion nowadays is always related to the historical and the culture. I think there is nothing new anymore in this moment. What we all do now is to look back into the past and re-develop what is already there… and combine it with our own style in a modern way. </p>
				
				<h3 class='delta'>Do we live in the cultural world? Since when?</h3>
				<p>Yes, we do. I guess since the human being was born to this world!</p>
				
				<h3 class='delta'>When you were a child, did you want to be a designer?</h3>
				<p>Never ! my parents wanted me to become a surgeon/doctor. I tried to focus on that but I gave up. And in fact, I'd prefer to be a rock star  and to have my own band, rather than my own brand!</p>
				
				<h3 class='delta'>What project has given you the most satisfaction / how?</h3>
				<p>I would never be satisfied by what I have done… I want to push myself to keep improving and to work harder next time. But one of my favourite collections is called BIAS in 2006. I did the whole collection by myself. I worked 24/7 hours and the end result was exactly what I wanted it to be.  </p>
				
				<h3 class='delta'>Can you describe an evolution in your work from your first projects to the present day?</h3>
				<p>At the beginning I was hesitating if I should concentrate on couture or prêt-à-porter. BIAS in 2006 was my very first collection. There are only 12 silhouettes with black and red colours in the collection.  Every detail was done by hand. I always prefer working by hand rather than machine. The collection was very couture. In terms of the choice of the materials, I played a lot of luxury fabrics every time. Before I start the design process I always look at the specific detail that I can develop and re-apply onto the silhouette. And for me detail is very important for a designer piece. It makes the difference between a designer piece and a mass product. From one season to another season, I realised that I needed to be more wearable in order to be able to sell the collection in boutique stores… and to eventually see women wearing what I had created outside and at day time, not only during an event or a soiree. If I compare my first collection to my most recent on, I would say everything seems more wearable and 'daily wear' style, but it all still has a high-twist of HH signature on it.</p>
				
				<h3 class='delta'>What are your historical references in art?</h3>
				<p>I am always curious about exploring more in the Gothic era. It is very interesting how the beauty of the gothic could inspire architecture, costumes back then and how it can still be an inspiration for us today.</p>
				
				<h3 class='delta'>Which artists and designers have inspired you and how?</h3>
				<p>I don't really have a specific artist/designer who inspired me every season or every time I work on my new collection. I find my inspiration from my emotions in that moment and also from everything I “feel” during the research and development process before the final stage. But I do have my favourite inspirational artist: Pierre Soulages. I think there is a deep spiritual connection between my work and his vision. I adore his work very much and the way he interpreted how when light is reflected on black, it transforms and transmutes it. It opens up a mental field all of its own. He only works on different types of black in his art pieces. And he believes that black painting is coming out from the darkness and into brightness.</p>
				
				<h3 class='delta'>Do you have any advice for young artists?</h3>
				<p>No, I never teach. But I am sometimes invited by fashion schools to give a speech and advice for the final year student on how to build their collection and concept till the final outcome. 
				My advice : keep going even though this industry is super-tough until you will reach one point at which you will realise that fashion is real business not just creating a beautiful and spectacular collection.</p>
				
				<h3 class='delta'>What are you afraid of regarding the future?</h3>
				<p>Bad things happen whether you are afraid or not, so I might as well not bother being scared of it. Think of the present time and the future goal. Never ever be scared of what steps you are going to take. Make mistakes as much as you can. It's the only way to help you grow up to become a better person in the future.</p>
