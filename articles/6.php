	<h3>Lao Tzu</h3>
	(c. 6th-5th century BCE) was a Chinese philosopher; also called Lao Zi, Lao Tzu, Lao Tse, or Lao Tze. The Tao te Ching  (道德經: Dào Dé Jīng, or Dao De Jing) represents the sole document generally attributed to Laozi.

	<blockquote>There is a thing inherent and natural which existed before heaven and earth.
Motionless and fathomless, It stands alone and never changes; It pervades everywhere and never becomes exhausted. It may be regarded as the Mother of the Universe. I do not know its name. If I am forced to give it a name, I call it Tao, and I name it as supreme.</blockquote>

<blockquote>'The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.' </blockquote>
<blockquote>'Simplicity, patience, compassion.
			These three are your greatest treasures.
			Simple in actions and thoughts, you return to the source of being.
			Patient with both friends and enemies,
			you accord with the way things are.
			Compassionate toward yourself,
			you reconcile all beings in the world.'
