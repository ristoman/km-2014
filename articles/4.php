				<p>Recently this year I attended a most intriguing and at the same time, enlightening exhibition: the 'Hermès Leather Forever' one, featuring some of the historic label's most famous designs, hosted in the Royal Academy Of Arts.  </p>

				<p><em>Vogue</em> advertised that 'Examples of its famous Kelly and Birkin bags will be included, as will items from the label's rich history - from saddles to silk scarves. The crucially-important artisans - who train for years to be able to replicate the attention to detail the brand has maintained since its 18th Century beginnings - will also be present at the exhibition, giving visitors and up-close, real-time insight into the manufacture of the brand's bags.'</p>

				<p>Well, it was exactly there when I visited it, even more mind blowing if I may say. The notion of avant-garde quality was everywhere, so were certain great statement pieces of the brand exposed along with others I felt happy to remember. The exhibits traced Hermès' history - from 19th Century saddle and harness-maker, to one of the most famous accessories brands of the 21st Century and not only. Items prepared for Wallis Simpson, some of the brands artisans actually 'recreating' the famous bag in front of spectators (now that was impressive!), indicated why Hermes maintains its place in the fashion market with its name oozing quality and elegance. </p>

<p>Even while those two don’t seem to come cheap. </p>";
