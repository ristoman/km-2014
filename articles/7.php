		<p><em>Compassion</em> is the feeling of
empathy for others. Compassion is the emotion that
we feel in response to the suffering of others that motivates a desire to
help.</p>

<p>Compassion is often regarded as having an emotional aspect to it, though
when based on cerebral notions such as fairness, justice and
interdependence, it may be considered rational in nature and its
application understood as an activity based on sound judgment. </p>

<p>There is also an aspect of compassion which regards a quantitative dimension, such
that individual's compassion is often given a property of 'depth,'
'vigour,' or 'passion.' The etymology of 'compassion' is Latin, meaning
'co-suffering.' More involved than simple empathy, compassion commonly
gives rise to an active desire to alleviate another's suffering.</p>

<p>Compassion is often, though not inevitably, the key component in what
manifests in the social context as altruism. In
ethical terms, the expressions down the ages of the so-called Golden
Rule often embodies by implication the principle of compassion: <em>Do to others what you
would have them do to you</em>.</p>

<p>The English noun <em>compassion</em>, meaning <em>to suffer together with</em>, comes
from Latin. Its prefix  <em>com-</em> comes directly from <em>com</em>, an archaic
version of the Latin preposition  and affix cum (= with); the
<em>-passion</em> segment is derived from <em>passus</em>.</p>

<p>Compassion is thus related in origin, form and meaning to the English noun
patient (= one who suffers), from <em>patiens</em>, present participle of the
same patior. Ranked a great virtue in numerous philosophies, compassion is
considered in almost all the major religious traditions as among the greatest
of virtues. </p>
