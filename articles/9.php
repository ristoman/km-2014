<p><strong>Why are you a designer and how did you get started?</strong></p>

<p>At some point I noticed that the style of interior space tells a story
about its residents. Design for me is taking that story and interacting
with it's past, present, and hope for future. It continues the story but
also becomes a part of it, creating and shaping experiences. I've been
privileged to see various expressions of interior design from houses and
flats to even yachts and other living and leisure spaces. I developed this
idea to be a part of this conversation happening in these living areas
using art.</p>

<p><strong>Could you tell us some more about your furniture art?</strong></p>

<p>Simply what I do is fuse contemporary art from emerging artists with
traditional cabinet making. CF-Design, which can be seen as my creative
lab, is basically a combination of the highest quality craftsmanship and
featured artists. My design works is combining these two into a working and
interesting new synthesis. So within each piece you can have another
reworked masterpiece created of a contemporary artist brought into the
third dimension. Each piece of my furniture art is handmade and unique,
carrying my branding and the original signature of the featured artist. The
production of each 'Carmen Franko' piece is highly elaborate, taking an
average of one month from layout until finalization. Selected images of
existing paintings or photographs by fresh but accomplished artists are
adjusted to the dimensions of the selected base furniture. Our
craftsmanship represents high-level expertise of dressing furniture with
special textile and aluminum prints, covered by several layers of resin and
lacquer. These lead to an effect of depth, somewhat like a magnifying
glass. The final process consists of buffing the surfaces with an ultra
fine polishing compound. The fixtures and other elements finish off the
piece, creating a new interaction between a compelling painting or
photograph and an elegant piece of furniture with traditional lines,
connecting mediums, epochs, and visions into a new visual conversation.</p>

<p><strong>Could you tell us some more about your work?</strong></p>

<p>My work can be seen as an artistic conversation between the past and the
present, a marriage between contemporary and antique. On top of this, I
enjoy experimenting with novel compositions - remaking classic pieces of
furniture in an avant-garde or a pop-art kind of way. Working this
juxtaposition takes a bit of time and I like to collaborate with the
original artist when possible. The end result should be a confident harmony
between these divergent ideas and forms, so it take a great deal of
reflection, thought, and trial and error to get the right placement and
bring every element together.</p>


<p><strong>What inspires you to work?</strong></p>

<p>What inspire me most of all are the artists that I meet and work with.
Everyone has their own unique approach to art and the life they lead. Each
of them explores a radically different style. I want to reflect that within
my work. I wish to go beyond common decorative product design and instead
breath new life into furniture, where antiques have a particular spirit and
shape. I get in touch with artists and exceptional furniture makers during
my frequent excursions. So I am constantly encountering art, antiques, and
accessories that inspire me to create these unique conceptions.</p>

<p><strong>You seem to use a lot of symbols in your work. Do your works tell stories
or are they simply decorative elements of the project?</strong></p>

<p>My work is definitely not only telling stories but also drawing the viewer
and resident to interact in a new story. With one foot firmly in the rich
past, the pieces are striding forward, through a spirited and interesting
present. Not only is there the story of the furniture and it's design as
well, but each piece reflects the featured artist and the voice of their
work, and finally the onlooker become a part of the conversation in using
the piece in their own story. The art never is placed and finished. It is a
living, working, experience in everyday life.</p>

<p><strong>What famous artists have influenced you, and how?</strong></p>

<p>Andy Warhol comes to mind first. His legacy includes all sorts of media
from painting to photography, from writing to movie making. Most of all I
love his idea of creating a Factory, where various talented artists blend
in their creative synergies by doing just what they feel like doing with
epic results. Also textile-designer, artist, and writer William Morris is a
great influence. He was connected to the Pre-Rafaelite movement, striving for intense colors and novel compositions. His design
firm worked such textiles onto furniture in the 19th century and this
inspires me not only for it's innovation and design but craftsmanship as
well. Another designer that I adore is Marcel Wanders. He strives for
beauty, uniqueness, and a combination of antiques with modern times, just
as I do. His products and interior designs are truly mind-blowing.</p>



<p><strong>What other interests do you have outside of your furniture design concept?</strong></p>

<p>I love to paint, to release myself give into some sort of flow, or to try
out things that I have never tried before. I'm crazy about experiences. I
have to admit that I can get bored easily. I love to explore and to excite
myself with all sorts of pleasure and inspiration: traveling, sports, good
cuisine, events, good conversations, magical and also mad moments.</p>

<p><strong>How would your life change if you were no longer allowed to create art?</strong></p>

<p>Well I am a creative person, so if I could not express myself through art
anymore, I would probably find another medium very quickly. Art is
everywhere. It is just a matter of definition. So I would create events
instead or write a book ... about art of course.</p>

<p><strong>What are your next projects?</strong></p>

<p>My furniture art can be found in selected galleries around the world. So my
next steps are to create even more collaborations with talented artists and
gallery partners and in this way expand CF-Design. Traveling and
coordinating my partners personally is a very important part of that. When
starting new projects the personal aspect is very important to me, since I
want to explore what is happening behind the scenes, and get to know the
story of each piece of art and its creator. There is always a particular
connection that inspires me to work with somebody special. Moreover I want
to visualize my projects by capturing the entire process of production from
traveling, talking to the artists, planning, and finalizing the pieces, to
the lifestyle of art and design that constantly surrounds my creative lab.
This will become an interesting art project in itself. It will also give my
collectors a better understanding of the process that lies behind the work. </p>
